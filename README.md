🧠 Philosophy
"We see things they’ll never see…” — Oasis

This toolkit was born from a simple need: demo secret-scanning tools in the most realistic way possible, without real leaks, with full automation, and with style.

It grew into a modular, CI-aware CLI that now installs via Homebrew.
Because automation should automate itself. 🚀
